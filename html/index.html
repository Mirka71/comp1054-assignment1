                All our times have come
                Here, but now they're gone

                Nor do the wind, the sun, or the rain

                Love of two is one 
                Here, but now they're gone
                Came the last night of sadness
                And it was clear she couldn't go on
                The door was open and the wind appeared
                The candles blew and then disappeared 
                The curtains flew and then he appeared

                (Saying, "don't be afraid") Come on, Baby
                (And she had no fear) And she ran to him
                (Then they started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye
                (She had become like they are) She had taken his hand
                (She had become like they are) Come on, Baby
                (Don't fear the Reaper)</pre>

    <!-- Add aside article to include band details -->

    <aside>According to Grunge, Blue Öyster Cult was initially formed under a different name in the 1960s by Albert Bouchard and Donald Roeser in New York. After years of adding members and renaming the band, they finally settled on Blue Öyster Cult in the 70s. furthermore, American Songwriter claimed that due to the culture around that time, they mainly focused on sci-fi themes and portrayed themselves as being esoteric and cult-like.</aside>
