            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <pre>
                All our times have come
                Here, but now they're gone
                Seasons don't fear the Reaper
                Nor do the wind, the sun, or the rain

                (Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
                (Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
                (Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man

                Valentine is done
                Here, but now they're gone
                Romeo and Juliet
                Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
                40,000 men and women everyday
                (Redefine happiness)
                Another 40,000 coming everyday

            <h3>Verse 3</h3>
            <pre>
                Love of two is one 
                Here, but now they're gone
                Came the last night of sadness
                And it was clear she couldn't go on
                The door was open and the wind appeared
                The candles blew and then disappeared 
                The curtains flew and then he appeared
            </pre>

            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <pre>
                (Saying, "don't be afraid") Come on, Baby
                (And she had no fear) And she ran to him
                (Then they started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye
                (She had become like they are) She had taken his hand
                (She had become like they are) Come on, Baby
                (Don't fear the Reaper)</pre>
